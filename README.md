## What is an API? What is a REST API?

An Application Programming Interface (API) is provided by a service owner so that others may use the features and functions enabled by the service. APIs describe how a consumer will make requests of the servuce, and what they will receive in return. [Read more](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-an-api).

A REST API allows software programs to expose functionality and data to other programs over the Internet in a consistent format. Generally speaking, when people use the term REST API, they are referring to an API that is accessed via the HTTP protocol at a predefined set of URLs (uniform resource locators) representing the various resources with which interactions can occur. [Read more](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-a-rest-api).

Twilio is an example of a REST API. Twilio's communication APIs let you do things like send text messages and emails, make phone calls, and stream video. You can see all of the things you can do with Twilio on the [Twilio docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs).

During MLH INIT, you will learn how to **send and receive text messages** and **make and receive phone calls** with Twilio.
